Hi


This is a demo of chatbot called anonyM developed by MANU SK


This is developed using python, tensorflow and google speech recognizion


This chatbot currently works with supervised learning .... which means we know the questions and responses.. we are going to train the 
machine based on the questions using tensorflow.


User can give two types of inputs to the bot : 1. Audio as an input( google's speech Reco is used)
					       2. Text as input ( normal python script input)

Small gramatical errors and spelling mistakes are not considered to give the responses in this chat bot


Here we have mainly 3 files
1. intents.json ---> This file contains the 'tag','patterns','responses' 
2. anonyM_trainer.py -----> This is used to train the machine based on the intents in intents.json file and is stored as anonyM_model.
   Tensorflow which is a ML library which is used to train the machine.
3. anonyM_bot.py -------> This is used to get the reponses for the questions which are asked to the machine.
   The pre-trained data using tensorflow(ML) is used here.
   
     
Now we will see the response for audio inputs
:)

Thank you:))

Ignore the 0's and 1's we are getting this because i'm just printing the classes and dictionaries
And the context_text will get printed as response if nothing you said matches the data
